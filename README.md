# A simple way to see your plans

This is a very simple calendar embed that uses dataview to find all of the
dated items you have in your vault and display them on a calendar grid.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Set it up so that it can display more than just the current year.
- [ ] Add a week and a day view
- [ ] add TOML support inside the triple-ticks to configure things like string substitutions and filters
- [ ] Add support for times on events
- [ ] Add support for recurring events. This probably needs to be its own file format, or at least it needs to use special syntax
- [ ] Add support for multi-day events.
